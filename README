Atmosphere-pubsub-spring-tiles contains two samples that show a very simplistic setup 
for Atmosphere/Spring/Tiles using the familiar code from the AtmosphereHandlerPubSub.java sample
re-written as a Spring Controller.

The samples were created to flesh out a bug introduced in 0.9-SNAPSHOT dealing with URLs and Tiles.
The alpha WAR runs fine.  The 0.9-SNAPSHOT WAR fails.

They are configured for JBoss EAP 5.1, but could be changed easily to deploy on other servlet containers.
